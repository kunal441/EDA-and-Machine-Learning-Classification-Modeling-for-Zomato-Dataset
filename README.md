# EDA-and-Machine-Learning-Classification-Modeling-for-Zomato-Dataset


- Here we are using different features to predict the rating of restaurants. Where the target is equal to 1 if the corresponding rate is >= 3.75 and target is equal 0 if the corresponding rate is < 3.75
- We have dropped the null values and pre-processed our data to make sure that the prediction is least affected due to it.
- We have dropped the null values and pre-processed our data to make sure that the prediction is least affected due to it.
- This model will give us 90% plus accuracy with Random Forest.
